## Motivation
During my senior year of high school, a friend leading a volunteer initiative asked me to build a website for their project. Seeing its potential to support environmental efforts, I took on the challenge. 

## Contributions
### Development
- Implement various UI components with CSS, including Carousel, Dropdown Menu, and Accordion
- Used a hybrid approach of SSR pages and CSR components to improve content loading speed
- Integrated Content Management System (CMS) based on GROQ Query with admin dashboard for non-developers

### Collaboration
- Create a low-fidelity Wireframe with Figma to collaborate with the UI designer
- Actively communicate with PO on Slack or in person to meet requirements promptly
